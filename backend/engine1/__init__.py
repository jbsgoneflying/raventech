"""Engine 1 v2 — Wing Decision Console.

Transforms the legacy "should I take this trade?" verdict machine into a
"where do I place my wings?" decision console. The desk is assumed to be
taking the trade; this engine tells them HOW to position for maximum
theta capture without breach-gap, breach-CTC, or White-Knuckle (MAE)
risk forcing an early exit.

Public entry points:

- :func:`score_placements` — fit a grid of (EM-multiple, wing-width)
  candidates, return ranked :class:`PlacementScore` objects plus the
  scoring context used.
- :func:`build_wing_console` — full pipeline: given a breach-stats
  payload + (ticker, event_date, event_timing), produce a
  :class:`WingConsolePayload` ready for the frontend / LLM advisor.

The scoring math is deterministic, cacheable, and auditable. The LLM
advisor (``POST /api/breach/advisor``) can still ride on top as an
on-demand narrative layer — this engine is the source of truth.
