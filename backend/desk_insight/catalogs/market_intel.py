"""Desk Insight catalog — Market Intelligence (home / front layer).

Market Intelligence is the desk's first-thing-in-the-morning surface:
cross-asset regime read, overnight-to-open diff, macro calendar, pattern
recognition, and per-asset drill-downs. These tooltips teach a new desk
hire what each tile is actually telling them and how it should shape
today's plan.
